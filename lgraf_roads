1. add global: current_road_radius
2. add this at the end of init-roads:
  ;; Set the current road radius, that is used for determining destinations of the first road
  set current_road_radius min-dist-roads

3. use this define-destination procedure

to define-destination

  ;; Clear the old destination and reset the minimum road distance radius
  set p_r1 nobody

  ;; Search for a patch that is not a road and has no roads within the defined radius
  ;; If the search does not succeed, the radius where road patches are allowed is reduced
